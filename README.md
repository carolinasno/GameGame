Parks and Recreation Trivia

The user will be alerted with a welcome message, followed by a prompt to obtain their name, which will be displayed under the "Parks and Recreation TRIVIA" header.

The user will not be able to move onto the next question unless a radio input has been selected. Once they've done so, the "next" button will be enabled.

Once all ten questions are answered, the final page shows your score.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this game. I approached this as a true trivia game shown with four multiple choices to each question. The installation was used via a website browser. Though you're able to select the answers, I was unable to have the scoreboard reflect the correct or incorrect answers selected. I also would have liked to include a replay and quit button, along with rounds as opposed to just the ten questions shown.
